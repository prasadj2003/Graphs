# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
## A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).


**Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. For example Google GPS.**

**Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). Each node is a structure     and contains information like person id, name, gender and locale.**

**Traversal Techniques**
- BFS(Breadth First Search)
  - The breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a tree or graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria. It starts at the treeâ€™s root or       graph and searches/visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Breadth-first search can be used to solve many     problems in graph theory.
- DFS(Depth First Search)
  - Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as    the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 


**Techniques to find MST**
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
